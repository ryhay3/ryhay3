Hi, I’m @ryhay3

I’m interested in creating an online database where users can input building material information specific to indigenous materials. 
I hope to create a database to streamline usage of local resources in green construction.

Trying to learn Tkinter, Flask, and about a million other Python extensions, but I'm a little lost as to where to really begin...
